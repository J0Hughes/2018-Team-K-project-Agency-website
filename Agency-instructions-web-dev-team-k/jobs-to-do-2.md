# Jobs to do, part 2: Building

Now we have the branding sorted out, let's start building a website.

We'll start with the HTML, get all of that sorted, then add CSS *next week*.

We want everyone to try building the HTML for your group's site. If you all work on and get familiar with code, it'll be easier to catch bugs and test your site.

## HTML for your agency site

You should start with our template code.

[Find the code on GitHub](https://github.com/mmu-webdesign/level5-portfolio/tree/master/CODE-for-team-website/)

[Here's how to download code from GitHub](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUNQy1U4Aic). You could also [download the zip file of all the code](https://github.com/mmu-webdesign/level5-portfolio/archive/master.zip).

The HTML doesn't contain all the code you need. However it does contain comments telling you where to find the other bits that you'll be working with.

## Adding the rest of the HTML we need for the site

### Add a title and metadata

Modify the HTML to add a title tag and metadata - describe your site and think about the kind of things Google would want to know about your agency (e.g. where are you? what do you specialise in?)

### Header HTML

Start by copying [the HTML code from the codepen](https://codepen.io/wilsondmmu/pen/MGWEzO) in the HTML comment into your page. Refresh the browser to make sure the change has worked. Then rewrite the HTML to suit your agency. [Validate your code](http://validator.w3.org/). 

### Update the team introduction and links

How does your group work? How will you convince people you are a professional, trustworthy agency? This is what your copy needs to do. Once your group is happy with the introduction, mark it up and add it to your group's template.

Read about [the five submission points in github](https://github.com/mmu-webdesign/level5-portfolio) and summarise each one. What are the benefits of the work you do for each submission point for your potential clients? Use these summaries as the link text for each submission point from your site. So for SP2, you might summarise that as 'We use a range of techniques to make sure the website we create meets your requirements'.

### Add a call to action

Create a link to `portfolio.html` for all the documents you will create throughout the unit - think carefully about the link text you use for this.

### Write the team bios

[Add the HTML code from the codepen](https://codepen.io/wilsondmmu/pen/yxyQoE) in the correct place and modify the code to suit your group, adding or removing people as necessary.

### Check the footer

Read through the footer code in the HTML and make any changes necessary. Web design is all about details. Even though the footer is pretty unexciting, you should care about everything on your agency page - don't give your client any reason to mistrust you!

### Validate your code again

Validate your code and view it in a web browser. As it's just HTML it'll be unstyled, but if you change the size of the browser window, or look at it on your phone, you'll see it's responsive! It's our job next week to not break this...

[So, once you've built your HTML, you need to style it](https://github.com/mmu-webdesign/level5-portfolio/blob/master/INSTRUCTIONS-for-creating-your-agency-site/jobs-to-do-3.md)
