# Pre-launch Checklist

We would like everyone to build a version of the group site first, then as a group to decide which will be submitted for SP1. 

**You can collaborate on a final version that uses work from any or all group members.**

Before you upload your final group site for us to look at, have you:

✏️ checked the metadata and title tags in the &lt;head&gt; of your site?  
✏️ Added a header image which includes your team's logo?  
✏️ Written an introduction to your team?  
✏️ Styled the list of links for each Submission point?  
✏️ Created a 'call to action' to the portfolio page (the portfolio page will eventually form the list of documents you need to have in your portfolio for your final submission)  
✏️ Added team member profiles  
✏️ Added optimised team member images  
✏️ Checked and completed the footer content  
✏️ Added your style guide page to your submission  
✏️ Once it's uploaded, have you checked your team site in multiple web browsers? (Including phone and tablet browsers)  
✏️ Have you checked your site for image optimisation and broken images in the chrome/firefox web developer tools?

🔦 **These are what we will be looking at when we give you feedback on this submission point**

😃 If your group works well during this short 'sprint' you should be fine when you come to create your Manchester guide website. 

😭 If you feel the group is having issues, or that the site could have been better, talk to us now before things get any worse 😱.
