# Jobs to do, part 4: Testing

## What do we mean by 'finished'?

Once you've got all the content in, and the design on it's way, your group needs to think about testing. Sometimes testing is easy, sometimes it can take longer than the original development time, depending on the complexity of the site.

## How to test

Here's the standard sort of testing procedure you'd find in most agencies. If you get really stuck, ask us for help. 

You will probably learn more if you try to fix things yourself first. 

**When debugging - slow down. Check everything. Be systematic.**

1. get some paper
2. validate your HTML and CSS. Fix any errors.
3. upload your site to some webspace
4. find as many computers, browsers and devices as you can
5. view your site in each device
6. switch off CSS if you can - does the site still make sense?
7. check the network tab in Chrome/Firefox - are there any missing files?
8. write down the problems you find: what is the issue? On which browser?
9. rank the problems by severity - fix the really bad ones first
10. go back to step 2
11. repeat until everything is fixed, or you've run out of time.

## Once you're happy with the final site

Well done, you've got a site for us to look at. [Head over to the checklist before you submit](https://github.com/mmu-webdesign/level5-portfolio/blob/master/creating-your-agency-site/pre-launch-checklist.md).
